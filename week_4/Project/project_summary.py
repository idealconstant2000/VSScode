Project Summary and Learning Objectives
======================================

This weather analysis project demonstrates key data analysis skills:

1. API INTEGRATION
   - Using Python's requests library to fetch data from external APIs
   - Handling HTTP errors and rate limiting with retry logic
   - Parsing JSON responses into Python data structures

2. DATA COMBINATION
   - Joining datasets using a common key (city name)
   - Handling missing data and unmatched records
   - Creating structured data for analysis

3. EXCEL REPORTING
   - Using openpyxl to create professional spreadsheets
   - Formatting with headers, borders, and styling
   - Auto-adjusting column widths for readability

4. ERROR HANDLING
   - Graceful fallback to mock data when APIs are unavailable
   - Comprehensive error messages and logging
   - Robust data validation

5. DATA ANALYSIS
   - Calculating statistics (averages, totals, extremes)
   - Identifying patterns in the data
   - Presenting insights in a clear format

Key Learning Outcomes:
- Understanding API data fetching workflows
- Data combination and transformation techniques
- Professional Excel report generation
- Real-world error handling and fallback strategies
- Data analysis and statistical calculations

This project simulates a real-world data analyst workflow where you:
1. Gather data from multiple sources
2. Clean and combine the data
3. Create professional reports
4. Extract meaningful insights
