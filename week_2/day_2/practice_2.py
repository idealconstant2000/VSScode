# ITP Week 2 Day 2 (In-Class) Practice 2

# Creating and Calling Functions

# Create a function called greetings that prints "Hello World!"
# def greetings():
#     print("Hello World!")

# Call greetings and run this Python file
#greetings()


# Create a function called add_num: 

def add_num():
    x = 5
    y = 7
    print(x + y)

# Inside your function define two variables: x and y, assign 5 to x and 7 to y
# print the sum of x and y

# Call your function
add_num()


# Create a function called subtract_num:

def subtract_num():

# Inside your function define two variables: x and y, assign 10 to x and 3 to y
# print the difference of x and y

    x = 10
    y = 3
    print(x - y)

# Call your function

subtract_num()

# Create a function called multiply_num:

def multiply_num():

# Inside your function define two variables: x and y, assign 5 to x and 7 to y
# print the product of x and y
    x = 5
    y = 7
    print(x * y)

# Call your function

multiply_num()


# Create a function called divide_num:

def divide_num():

# Inside your function define two variables: x and y, assign 10 to x and 2 to y
# print the quotient of x divided by y

    x = 10
    y = 2
    print(x / y)

# Call your function

divide_num()
